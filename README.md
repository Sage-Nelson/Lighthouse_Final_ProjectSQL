# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL
---

## Project/Goals
(fill in your description and goals here)
Five .csv files were used to create a PostgreSQL ecommerce database. The tables were transformed and used to generate insight to how online users perceived online products and revenue generated in the process. The product preference of online customers (visitors) was also assessed.

## Process
### Data were imported into PostgreSQL database and appropriate data formats were assigned to them.

### The data needed for each analysis were cleaned and transformed before the start of the process. NULL values were either filtered out or assigned 0, where needed.

## Results
### I used the data to answer the question on the products online users were most likely attracted to. In some cases, price of products were not key determinants of user preference. Location also played important role in how well users rated the products.

## Challenges 
### The key challenge was casting incompatible datatypes into the desired formats before analysis. Another challenge was the large number of null values present in the dataset which almost rendered some of the attributes redundant.

## Future Goals
###I would probably have enough time to link some of the null attributes to some other non-null attributes so as to generate answers to some unanswered questions. For instance, how is the revenue (in the analytics table) associated with the product refund amount of the all_sessions table?
